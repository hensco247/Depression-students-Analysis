 Objective:
 
This analysis investigates the relationship between dietary habits and the duration of study hours among students, aiming to uncover how nutritional behavior may impact academic performance through study endurance.

 Key Findings

Correlation Coefficient (r): 0.73`
  Indicates a strong positive correlation between dietary habits and study duration.

Regression Equation:
 Y = 22.6X - 603.2`
  This implies that an improvement in dietary habit score (X) is associated with a corresponding increase in predicted study hours (Y).

R² Value: 0.534
  Approximately 53.4% of the variation** in study duration can be explained by dietary habits.

 Interpretation :

* A healthier and more consistent dietary pattern — including meal regularity, quality, and balance — correlates with increased energy levels, better focus, and longer study hours.
* Poor dietary habits (e.g., high sugar intake, irregular meals) can lead to fatigue and reduced concentration, negatively impacting the effectiveness and duration of study sessions.

 WHY IT MATTERS

* Enhancing dietary habits may serve as a non-academic strategy to improve student performance by boosting cognitive endurance.
* This insight is critical for educators, parents, and students aiming to optimize academic outcomes through lifestyle improvements.

Recommendations

Students should adopt healthier eating patterns and maintain regular meal schedules to sustain longer and more productive study hours.
Institutions may consider including dietary education as part of academic support programs.
